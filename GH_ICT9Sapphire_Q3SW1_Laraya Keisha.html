	<div class="row">
		<div class="container col-xl-8 text-dark"><h5>Sakurako Kujō is a genius beauty in her mid-twenties whose life is centered around one thing and one thing only: bones. With little tolerance for others, she would be completely isolated in her study full of skeletons if it weren't for high school boy Shotaro—her new assistant and constant companion.</h5></div>

 		<div class="container col-xl-4 text-dark"><h5>Sakurako Kujō (九条 櫻子 Kujō Sakurako?) is the titular heroine of the series alongside Shōtarō Tatewaki. She is a trained osteologist with a passionate interest in skeletons and bones, which she collects and displays in her home.</h5></div>
 	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="container col-xl-8"><h5>Sakurako is a very beautiful, seductive and intelligent young woman but has difficulty socializing because of her aloof and superior demeanor. Thanks to her knowledge of physiology, her appreciation of detail, and having been mentored by a renowned forensic scientist (her uncle Shitara Kujō), she is an exceptional detective and frequently aids the local prefectural police in their murder investigations. Her fiancé works with the Hokkaido Prefectural Police. She also likes eating sweets, the more expensive the better.</h5></div>

		<div class="container col-xl-4 text-dark"><h5>Shōtarō Tatewaki (館脇 正太郎 Tatewaki Shōtarō) is the 15 year old main protagonist of the series along with Sakurako Kujō. He is a first year attending a local high school in the prefecture where Sakurako lives.<h5></div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="container col-xl-8 text-dark"><h5>He jokingly refers to himself as Sakurako's "caretaker"—possibly in reference to the fact that Sakurako has difficulty interacting socially with others without him acting as an interpreter for her antisocial behavior and speech. In narration, he describes their relationship as "not romantic, nor is it a friendship".</h5></div>
		<br>
		<div class="container col-xl-8 text-dark"><h5>He often accompanies Sakurako on her bone-digging expeditions, and is seen to frequently spend his free time at her estate where she teaches him about bones. When someone needs her help with forensic or investigative matters, they often approach Shōtarō first, as without his insistence she would most likely refuse.</h5></div>
		<br>
		<div class="container col-xl-8 text-dark"><h5>Shōtarō is very kind and patient, which allows him to tolerate Sakurako's cold, antisocial demeanor. She often refers to him simply by the Japanese pronoun shonen (literally, "boy") rather than using his real name—often to his annoyance. Despite this, he cares for her a great deal and takes personal responsibility for a lot of her actions and social missteps.</h5></div>
